###Installation Guide
It’s very important to have in mind all the packages and plugins that you need to implement in the Visual Studio, to develop multi-platform apps without having any problem. If you don’t install all the components correctly, you’ll suffer a lot of errors in the compilation and deployment because Xamarin has a lot of dependencies, like Windows 10 SDK or Android SDK. So, these are the packages that you must install in the Visual Studio or Xamarin Studio:

If your Visual Studio is already installed, you can go to Programs and Features in the Control Pane, and right click in Visual Studio. Select Change and then you can install all the packages missed.
