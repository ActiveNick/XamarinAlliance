# Coding Challenge 1: Getting set up

## Introduction
Welcome to our first #XamarinAlliance coding challenge. Through a series of **coding challenges** you'll learn how to develop cross-platform mobile apps using Xamarin and also how you can integrate Azure services to make your apps **connected**. You can expect to see a new coding challenge become available every two weeks.

## <a name="description"></a>Challenge Description

The goal of this first coding challenge is to **set up your development environment for Xamarin development** and have a Xamarin up-and-running on your machine. This will be the basis for the next coding challenges, where you'll further expand the functionality of the app.

For those of you who have never used Xamarin or have no idea what app to build, we want to give you a head start by providing you a basic **Xamarin Alliance template app**. If, on the other hand, you already have experience in building Xamarin apps or you have a great idea in mind for an app, you can also complete the coding challenges by ***building your own app***.

Regardless of whether you use the template app or build your own, make sure to add some **creativity** to your coding challenges! Feel free to tweak the user interface and design, use other data sources or add more functionality to make your app really stand out. Throughout the coding challenges, we'll give you some ideas on how you could further improve the app.

With Xamarin you can build cross-platform mobile apps and you can do so on **Windows or Mac**, with Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac respectively. For doing the coding challenges, we leave it up to you to decice which platform you want to develop on.

The goal of the Xamarin Alliance template app is to allow the user to display the list of Star Wars characters.  In the first version of the app we'll only have a single list page which lists the different characters and some details, with no further interaction on these items. The character data is stored in a JSON document and packaged inside the app. In the next coding challenges, we'll improve and expand the functionality of the app.

**TIP:** if you're not into Star Wars, you could easily modify the app template to display recipes, movies, your favorite team's players, etc. Also, feel free to restyle the app, which is currently fairly bland.

The solution for the Xamarin Alliance template app contains projects for Windows UWP and Android. You can remove any of these projects, depending on your development environment or preference (e.g. you cannot develop UWP on Mac).

All data in the template app is courtesy of [StarWars.com](http://www.starwars.com/databank).
    

## <a name="details"></a>Challenge Details

To complete this coding challenge, you need to achieve the following steps:

1. Set up and install the development tools
2. Get a Xamarin app running on your developer machine

1. Setup and install the tools

	Follow the [guide for getting set up](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt613162.aspx) with Xamarin and Visual Studio 2015.<br/>
	If the installation fails, you can [perform a manual install](https://www.xamarin.com/faq#qxvs-installer-failing).

2. Get the Xamarin Alliance template app
